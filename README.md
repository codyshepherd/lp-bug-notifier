# lp-bug-notifier

The purpose of this application is to be a minimal, terminal-based tool for getting updates on Launchpad bugs of interest. 

1. Add a bug to follow with `add <bug #>`, and the application will poll LP for updates on that bug.
2. Bug status and messages will be updated and displayed automatically in summary form
3. Drop a bug you no longer care about with `drop <bug #>`

That's it.
